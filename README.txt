I have classified my projects in terms of difficulty and goal. 
In the simple code file, I added some projects I made back when I was starting to code so they're pretty easy and simple
In the intermediate programs file, I added projects concentrated on a specific coding concept like string hadnling, working with dictionaries, if statement handling and lists
In the data handling and visualization file, I added projects that I made focused solely on dataframes and plotting them. My projects there include cleaning the given data, sorting it, changing the varibale tyes and many more
